      <h1>Why I dropped out of High School</h1>
      <h2>This is my story.</h2>
      <p>
        <i class="fa fa-paragraph"></i>
        Last October I dropped out of the eleventh year of school
        because I was exhausted by the education system’s constant
        efforts to make squares out of circles. It took almost six
        months to convince my family that it was the right decision for me
        and there are still some people who think it was a poor one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I considered the advantages and disadvantages of leaving school
        without intending to attend college or university. I came to the
        conclusion that public schools in general are obsessed with good
        grades and test scores and therefore result in nothing more than
        years of regurgitation. I strongly believe that I should use my
        teenage years to gain as much knowledge as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since dropping out I have been given the opportunity to work with
        multiple startups around Vancouver, in positions such as a User
        Interface designer and a Core iOS Developer. From being out there,
        I quickly made a multitude of amazing connections. Recently, I decided
        to quit my full-time job to realise my full potential as an entrepreneur.

        While attending a hackathon at the University of Michigan I met
        Cristopher Bello, a machine learning guy and liberal arts student who
        takes an interest in psychology. Cris brought to my attention that most
        freshmen believe that they can only be successful with the ‘right’ major.
        I’ve quoted him:
      </p>

      <p>
        <blockquote>
          <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
          It appears to be a recurring theme when you talk to Highschool
          seniors and College freshmen: You ask them what they’re going to major
          in and they start ‘weighing out’ the decisions. You ask them their
          reasoning and they say ‘Well, I /can/ do this or do that with x
          degree.’ But then I ask “With who’s permission?” — a question that
          each and every one of them has greeted with a shrug. Successful people
          will always be successful no matter what they do and no matter where
          they go.

        Here are a few things that I’ve learnt through dropping out of school to pursue my dreams:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Feeling like the world is against you.</strong> Living in
            the conservative society that I do, I have received remarks
            from teachers, my family, pseudo friends and local recruiters
            attempting to dissuade me from dropping out and now that I have,
            why to return. I am a natural born ENTJ, built to excel in an
            efficient way, with the confidence and charisma to inspire and
            lead teams. Walking into battle with my double-ended sword does
            not frighten me. I am not easily offended and I hate the status
            quo. I thrive on a naysayers constant urge to put others down
            because as long as I am doing well a pessimist will be lurking.
            I do not believe or experience doubt and I truly believe anything
            and everything can be accomplished with enough determination and
            dedication.

              You don’t need permission (qualifications) to go out
              there and start doing.

            <strong>Education is not limited to the bounds of a classroom.</strong>
            I have always known that I am better off in an environment where I learn by
            doing; Over the past five months the amount of knowledge I’ve acquired is
            insane! I am traveling around the world to see things with my own eyes that
            exhilarate and cultivate my lust for being introduced to new experiences.
            Formal education is great for teaching theory, but often students miss out
            on the real-life experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Experiences over materialistic things.</strong> Since leaving school,
            I started to realise and implement a tactic that the most inspiring individuals
            around the globe have used: Use your resources to fund experiences rather than
            purchasing things; Even a bad experience becomes a good story. I only purchase
            what I think will contribute to my success.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You do not need everything.</strong> A good entrepreneur is not a
            consumerist. We purchase what we need to do the job, not fun or unnecessary
            possessions. Don’t fund distractions, fund genuine experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>It’s not easy.</strong> I am amused by those who approach me with
            remarks such as “Since you dropped out you have 100x more time.” or
            “School is way harder than what you’re doing right now.” — I am up 15/7
            working on something. No matter what the occasion is, no matter what the
            weather is, I’m working. I’m 100% responsible for holding myself accountable,
            for keeping myself disciplined.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>I inspire people.</strong> I love coming out to support the
            community. I take pride in talking about where I came from and how
            much I have improved: A different child who was rejected from
            society to high school dropout entrepreneur that doesn’t have a
            care in the world other than making my life worth it and touching
            those around me to make a larger dent in the universe.
          </li>
        </ol>

        This is your life; live it.
